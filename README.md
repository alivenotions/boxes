# Introduction

## What is this all?

This is a wiki for all the things that I have learned and what I am learning right now. This might include summaries of books that I have read or topics that I am learning about. This will grow over time and topics inside can be easily searchable. Most of the things will be tech related initially, but I will see if I can start putting other things in here too.

This is directly inspired from [nikitavoloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) and there is a lot of good things there and you should definitely check it out.
