# Introduction

## What is this all?

This is a wiki for all the things that I have learned and what I am learning right now. This will grow over time and topics inside can be easily searchable. Most of the things will be tech related initially, but I will see if I can start putting other things in here too.

This is directly inspired from \[[nikitavoloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/)\]\([https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/)\) and there is a lot of good things there and you should definitely check it out.
