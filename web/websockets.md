# Websockets

1. Web-socket protocol allows the browser and server to exchange data over a persistent connection.
2. It is beneficial in situations where real-time or near real-time communication is needed.
3. It is a lightweight protocol and there are no headers or metadata associated with the packets that are transmitted.
4. This barebones approach also means that it may require a layer on top of the protocol for categorising the messages according to the system. This is a drawback according to me as this can lead to different abstractions in every project.
5. There is an alternative to this for near real-time communication in the form of HTTP2 + SSE, but I don't know enough about it right now. \(explore this further in the future\)
